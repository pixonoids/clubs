            Chaya self sustaining low cost housing scheme aims to set a standard, among the traditional conventional design solutions. The project stands as a self dependant community, requiring little or no help from the outside world. Each housing unit, carrying 8 solar panels on the sloping timber roof, produces more energy on an average, then what it needs. thus the excess energy being supplied to nearby communities.Installation resembling inverted mushroom have been clustered at varying heights, to serve as a basin for rainwater collection overall the individual units are clustered in a 5 unit pentagonal scheme which share the common resources and several pentagonal clusters are further arranged together to serve as a community.All the individual units use composting toilets which require typically no water for operation and yield organic compost as a by-product which is either used or sold to generate economy.The structure typically comprises of sturdy light weight precast columns and mudblocks. mudblocks are considered to be most sustainable material with lowest embodied and demolition energy. the mudblocks being manufactured on site boost local economy.

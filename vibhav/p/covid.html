        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          This project is made to prevent the spread of Covid-19. A device is made which can
          perform multiple operations such as mask detection, temperature measurement and sanitization using combination
          of
          different hardware.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Abstract:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          The system is designed to detect the faces and to determine whether the person has worn a
          face mask or not. Using the above data, we can decide whether the concerned person can be allowed
          inside public places such as market or a hospital. This project can be used in the hospitals, markets,
          bus terminals, restaurants, and other public gatherings where the monitoring has to be done. This
          project consists of a camera that will capture the images of the people entering public places and detect
          whether the person has worn a face mask . A sanitizing device and
          automatic door opening technology will also be used.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Execution:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          When any person puts his/her hand in front of the device, it checks the body
          temperature using the temperature sensor. Simultaneously, it checks whether the person is wearing a
          mask or not using Machine learning. If required conditions are satisfied then only door will
          open automatically . If required conditions are not satisfied then the device glows a red LED and alerts
          everyone using buzzer.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Applications:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          • This device can be used at the entrance of crowded places such as malls, offices, shops,
          stadiums, hospitals, markets, bus terminals, restaurants, and other public gatherings . <br>
          • This device will be really useful for today's world due to this pandemic situation and will
          surely help in fighting against the virus.It will control the spread of COVID-19. <br>
          • It makes the process of temperature checking contactless and more safe. <br>
          • The device is available at an affordable price that makes it suitable for the users. <br>

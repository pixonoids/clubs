        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Objective:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          The aim of this project is to eliminate the long queues in front of the bill counters in the malls and, thus making
shopping in the malls and the supermarkets hassle-free and more automated, which will save a lot of time of the
customers.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Abstract:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          Shopping is easy but waiting on a bill counter after shopping is too boring and tedious. In this project, we
have transformed a normal cart into a self-billing cart. The designed system will be placed in the shopping
trolley itself, as the items are placed in the cart, they are detected and their price is shown in the app.
Hence, the shopping bill is automatically generated by the customer through the app we made, and the
customer can pay via UPI through the payment gateway integrated into the app. In the cart, just add
your things and you can see your bill in the app and just pay it from your phone.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-gray-200 my-6">Execution:</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400 my-6">
          • The system consists of an RFID reader which is connected to the NodeMCU.<br>
          • Every product has an RFID tag attached to it. Every tag has a unique identification number associated
          with it.<br>
          • Firstly, the user connects the app with the trolley. Whenever the shopper puts any product in the trolley, it
          is detected by the RFID reader and the corresponding UID is sent to the app by NodeMCU through a
          cloud server. It displays the details related to the corresponding product on the app.<br>
          •When the user is done with the shopping, he can click on ‘End Shopping’ on the app, and then the total
          amount is calculated including discounts and tax.<br>
          • The user can pay the specified amount through the payment gateway integrated into the app using UPI or
          credit/debit cards.<br>
          • In case if a customer changes his/her mind and doesn’t want any product added to the trolley he/she
          can remove it and the price added will be deducted automatically.<br>
        </p>

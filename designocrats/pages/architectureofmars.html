            The  team Design-o-crats is trying to develop a conceptual design for a permanently manned, self-sustaining martian facility, to accommodate scientists travelling to mars in 2030. The goal is to incorporate the major functions required for long term habitation in the isolation of a barren planet into a thriving ecosystem. So to create such habitat , the team has used 3-d printing technology that will help in deep space exploration. The ongoing researches say that the most suitable material for this erection is Nacre as it is strong and it stacks microscale and nanoscale components together in a brick-like structure and uses soft material to bind them together. The degree of radiation exposure on the surface of Mars is much higher than that of Earth, suggesting that a curved isolated structure could be used as a radiological protection for astronauts to live in such an environment. The gravity on Mars is lower than that on Earth, there is increased solar radiation, temperature cycles, and the high internal forces needed for pressurized habitats to contain air. Hence bearing these things in mind, this structure has been given a parametric and curved roof construction. This isolated establishment will bestow the most ideal conditions for a survival and will prove to be a faultless complex on mars.

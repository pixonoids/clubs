                    With this quote in mind, we devised a ground-breaking sailing technology known as " The Ocean
                    Cleanup". A boat that moves like a snake and is operated remotely, travelling freely through the
                    environment and cleaning the oceans. We're using cellulose sheets packed with polysulphide polymer,
                    which is made up of refining and petroleum by products. The polymer is hydrophobic by nature. If the
                    polymer has absorbed the oil, it will turn into a sponge, and the oil will be squeezed out using
                    rollers, allowing the sheets to be reused.
